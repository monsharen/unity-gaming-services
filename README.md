# Unity Gaming Services Demo

This application implements the following Unity gaming services:
- Authentication
- Analytics
- Lobby

# Scenes
The project is divided into three parts/scenes where we can explore Unity gaming services in separation: 
- Start scene
- World Map scene
- Trading Hub scene

## Start Scene
This scene implements Unity Authentication. This is a great place to add authentication related UI in case we wish to extend the project with custom authentication flows.

## World Map Scene
Travel to nearby planets. This scene implements Analytics to help us identify which planets players travel to.

## Trading Hub Scene
This scene uses Lobby to add a social aspect to the game and provide a sense of a living universe.
